You can start using Signal K by

* connecting to the demo server on the Internet with a browser
* installing either Node or Java server on any computer
* get some hardware for your boat, such as a Raspberry Pi, suitable interfaces (NMEA0183, [Nmea 2000](http://actisense.com) or roll your own with I2C) and
* purchase a commercial Signal K gateway
  * iKommunicate by Digital Yacht
  * xx by vyacht
* installing OpenPlotter, which includes a Signal K server
* hopefully by using OpenCPN someday

Once you have a server running (or you start by using the demo server) you can install some Signal K supporting iOS App such as
* NMEARemote by Zapfware
* Android App?
