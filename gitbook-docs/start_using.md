# Getting Started in Using Signal K

You can start using Signal K by

* connecting to the [demo server](http://demo.signalk.org/) on the Internet with a browser
* installing either [Node](https://github.com/signalk/signalk-server-node) or [Java](https://github.com/signalk/signalk-server-java) server on any computer
* getting some hardware for your boat, such as a [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), suitable USB adapters for your boat's network ([NMEA0183](http://digitalyacht.co.uk/product_info.php?products_id=11652Cached), [Nmea 2000](http://www.actisense.com/products/nmea-2000/ngt-1/ngt-1.html) or roll your own with [I2C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C) sensors) and installing Node or Java server
* purchasing a commercial Signal K gateway such as iKommunicate by Digital Yacht
* installing OpenPlotter, which includes a Signal K server

Once you have a server running (or you start by using the demo server) you can install some Signal K supporting mobile App such as
* [NMEARemote](http://www.zapfware.de/en/products/nmearemote/) by Zapfware (iOS)
* [OceanIX](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easybizness.oceanIX) (Android)
