# REST API

Signal K producers MAY implement an HTTP API which consumers can use to self-configure, poll for Signal K data or make
configuration changes. As specified in the previous section, all URLs for interacting with Signal K are rooted at
`/signalk`.

A Signal K server implementing the HTTP API may support http/2.

## GET /signalk

Making a `GET` request to `/signalk` returns a JSON object which specifies the available Signal K endpoints and some
information about the server. Also see [versioning](versioning.md) for details about `version` strings.

This response is defined by the `discovery.json` schema. In this example, the server supports two versions of the
specification: `1.alpha1` and `3.0`. For each version, the server indicates which transport protocols it supports and
the URL that can be used to access that protocol‘s endpoint. Clients should use one of these published endpoints based
on the protocol version they wish to use.

The server must only return valid URLs and should use IANA standard protocol names such as `http`. However, a server
may support unofficial protocols and may return additional protocol names; for example, the response above indicates
the server supports a `signalk-tcp` stream over TCP at on port 8367.

A server may return relative URIs that the client must resolve against the base of the original request.

A server MAY return information about itself in the `server` property. The id and version scheme is not defined as part
of the specification and there is no registry for id values. If providfed, the `id` and `version` MUST be the same values
as `swname` and `swvers` within the [DNS-SD advertisement](connection.md) (if implemented), and also the `id` MUST
provide the same value as `name` within the [Websocket hello message](streaming_api.md) (if implemented).

## /signalk/«version»/api/

**Note the trailing slash in the path**

The base URL MUST provide a Signal K document that is valid according to the full Signal K [schema
specification]({{site.baseurl}}specification.html). The contents SHOULD be all the current values of the data items the
server knows in the Signal K full format as specified in [Full and Delta Models](data_model.md).

## /signalk/«version»/api/*

The Signal K data SHOULD be available via the REST API. For example, `GET /signalk/v1/api/vessels` should return all
of the data under the `vessels` container in JSON format. Likewise, `GET
/signalk/v1/api/vessels/urn:mrn:signalk:uuid:c0d79334-4e25-4245-8892-54e8ccc8021d` should return data for one specific
vessel. In other words, the full Signal K data model SHOULD be traversable by any client making GET requests to an
arbitrary depth.

## History snapshot retrieval

A server MAY support retrieving historical data. The history snapshot retrieval endpoint is `/signalk/v1/snapshot` and functions like the full model endpoint at `/signalk/v1/api`. The client specifies the requested timestamp with request parameter `time`, for example `https://localhost:3443/signalk/v1/snapshot/vessels/self?time=2018-08-24T15:19:09Z`. The server will attempt to create the request part of the full model at the requested time.

A server MAY respond with `501 Not Implemented` status code if it does not support history snapshot retrieval and with `400 Bad Request` if it does not have data for the requested timestamp. A `404 Not Found` response is also acceptable to be backwards compatible.
